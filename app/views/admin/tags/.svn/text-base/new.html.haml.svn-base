  Labels are usually added while editing pages or uploading assets. 
  In both cases you can create several labels at once just by typing a list into the 'keywords' field.
  Or you can create and describe them one at a time here:
  
- form_for :label, :url => labels_path, :html => { :method => "post", :multipart => true } do |form|
  = render :partial => 'form', :locals => { :form => form }
